  desc: <p>A good friend of mine once told me "Sky is the limit, buddy". That's the best motivational sentence I've ever heard, but I strongly believe that no limit is too high when you deeply love what you do. This is what I feel about computer science. I am an enthusiastic software engineer passionate about technologies and always seeking for new tough goals to achieve and stars to reach for.</p><p>I earned my MSc in Padua and I've been an Erasmus student in Belgium, at KU Leuven. I realized that the highest results are reachable only as long as you are part of a team. That might not be the fastest way, but you'll never get to the top on your own.</p><p>My academic path focused on the design of reliable, safe, and secure systems as well as on the software running on them. I can program in many languages, including, but not limited to, C, C++, Java, Scala, JavaScript, Haskell, and Solidity. I am passionate about what's under the hood of programming, with special interests on its formal and verification aspects.</p>
